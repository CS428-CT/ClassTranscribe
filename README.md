## Project Overview
Class Transcribe is a platform that students use to view lecture videos from their instructors. However, Class Transcribe only comes in the form of a web app, which has many downsides, including inconveniencing students. This project focuses on creating a mobile application for Class Transcribe. This application aims to allow students to find, watch, and download lecture videos for their classes.

## Getting Started
