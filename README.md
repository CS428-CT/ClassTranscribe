## Project Overview
Class Transcribe is a platform that students use to view lecture videos from their instructors. You can view the main repository for Class Transcribe [here](https://github.com/classtranscribe). However, Class Transcribe only comes in the form of a web app, which has many downsides, including inconveniencing students. This project focuses on creating a mobile application for Class Transcribe. This application aims to allow students to find, watch, and download lecture videos for their classes.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You must have node.js and yarn installed. \
For node, make sure you install version 12.21.0. Newer versions may not yet be supported by expo. You can install node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.21.0/) \
After installing node, npm should be automatically installed. Use npm to install yarn with `npm install --global yarn`. See more details [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)

You will also need the Android Device Bridge and potentially an emulator if you don't own a physical device. It is recommended to install all of this through Android Studio for sake of simplicity. Download and install Android studio from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=CjwKCAjw7diEBhB-EiwAskVi13Wj1U0mZxs7_MaFBeVA9NBgrBwLXBHQXV3OqOCac42s21GPZAW9_BoC8twQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

### Dependencies
After cloning the repo, run `yarn install` in the root of the project to install all dependencies. View package.json to see a list of all dependencies that will be installed.

### Running
Currently only Android is supported. First you must have a device to run this application on. Either start up an emulator or plug in your phone. After doing so, run `yarn android` and the application should automatically be installed with expo.
